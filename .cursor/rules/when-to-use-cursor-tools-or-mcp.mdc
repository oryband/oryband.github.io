# Always prefer Cursor built-in Tools over MCPs over Terminal Commands

For example:

- Always prefer Cursor built-in Grep tool instead of `grep` terminal command
- Always prefer Cursor built-in List Directory over Filesystem MCP `list_directory` action over `ls` terminal command
- Always prefer Cursor built-in edit file over Filesystem MCP `edit_file` action over terminal commands.
- Always prefer Filesystem MCP `move_file` action over `mv` terminal command.
- Always prefer GitHub MCP `create_pull_request` action instead of calling `gh` command line utility.

And so on.

# Use the most fitting MCP for the job

When deciding to use an MCP, use the most fitting one for the job at hand. For example, if you need to read a GitHub issue's contents, prefer the GitHub MCP over Fetch MCP.
