# Filesystem MCP instructions

This file contains instruction on when to use or not to use the Filesystem MCP.

## Prefer built-in Cursor agent actions over Filesystem MCP actions

Whenever Cursor has a built-in functionality or agent action that overlaps what the Filesystem MCP action provides, always prefer the built-in Cursor action. For example:

- When editing a file, use Cursor agent edit feature, and do not use Filesystem remove and write file. This has the benefit of seeing the diff instead of the files abruptly change.
- List directories using Cursor's agent instead of Filesystem MCP actions.

## Filepaths

When executing actions that involve paths, always state the full path, for example 

GOOD:

```
{
  "source": "${workspaceFolder}/.plan/741-refactor-deprecate-video-date-fields",
  "destination": "${workspaceFolder}/.plan/749-refactor-deprecate-video-date-fields"
}
```

BAD:

```
{
  "source": ".plan/741-refactor-deprecate-video-date-fields",
  "destination": ".plan/749-refactor-deprecate-video-date-fields"
}
```

## Ask for permission before executing "destructive" actions

For example, ask for permission before removing or moving files. This avoids scenarios where we accidently damage existing work.
